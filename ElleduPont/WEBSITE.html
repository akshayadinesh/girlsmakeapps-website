<h2>What is Bookville?</h2>
           <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookville is website that I created for book recommendations for different types of books and readers. I will have different book lists for different types of book (ex. adventure fantasy, history, non-fiction, exct.) If you don't know what to read, or just are really bored with your book, you can look at the lists I have on here and maybe pick a new one. You can also look at my tips and tricks for making a book interesting. </h3>

      <h2>Getting an Account</h2>
          <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would think that you don't need an account for this website, and you would be right. However, getting an account will help us suggest different books for you . It also allows you to save discussions so you can talk on them later.</h3>

      <h2>Discussions</h2>
          <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions are like group chats that you can set up and join in. They are just chats, where a bunch of people talking about a specific book or genre, where you can add your opinion.You can also make your own, and only invite special people, or make it public, where anyone can join.</h3>
