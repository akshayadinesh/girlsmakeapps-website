<h2>SOCCER</h2>
<p>I have played soccer my whole life. I started when I was three years old. I have played on a travel team for five years. Last season my team won our league division. It is my passion, and I play whenever I can. I was really inspired to keep playing when the US Women's Soccer Team won the World Cup in 2015.</p>

<h2>MUSIC</h2>
<p>Music has always been a big part of my life. I listen to all different music genres. I also play the clarinet in my school band and have been doing this for three years now. My dad has played guitar for a long time and has taught me a little bit about playing one.</p>

<h2>ANIMALS</h2>
<p>I love all animals! Some of my favorites are dogs and pigme goats. I have a pet dog named Frankie and he is about seven years old. I love dogs because they are loyal and exciting. I love pigme goats because they are very energetic and funny.</p>
