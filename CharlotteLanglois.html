				<p> Field Hockey is one of my favorite sports. I have been playing for many years. I play mostly all year round: during the season, in fall, indoor field hockey in the winter, a clinic in the spring, and a camp during the summer.</p>
			<h3> Dance</h3>

				<p> I am in my school choir and have been singing for three years. I sing alto which is the harmony not the melody :(.</p>
			<h3>Music I like</h3>
				<p>I listen to music almost 24/7. I listen to artists such as Imagine Dragons, Kygo, The Script, Fall Out Boy, Lauv and others.</p>
